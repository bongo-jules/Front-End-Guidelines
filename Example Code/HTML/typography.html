<!--
| Headings
| ========
| Headings should be used with a document outline in mind. Ensure they follow a correct order
| which is kept consistent throughput the site.
|
| To visually change heading weighting without affecting the document outline, consider the
| Double-Stranded Heading Hierarchy - http://csswizardry.com/2012/02/pragmatic-practical-font-sizing-in-css/
-->

<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>

<!-- An example of the Double-Stranded Heading Hierarchy -->
<h3 class="h2">Heading 3 which looks like a Heading 2</h3>


<!--
| Paragraphs
| ==========
| Paragraph elements are used for grouping sections of text. Use CSS to add bottom margins
| to space paragraphs apart - never use multiple <br> tags for this purpose.
| There is very little reason to ever use <br> tags in HTML (outside of <address> elements).

<p>Donec congue lacinia dui, a porttitor lectus condimentum laoreet. Nunc eu ullamcorper orci.</p>
<p>In pellentesque faucibus vestibulum. Nulla at nulla justo, eget luctus tortor. Nulla facilisi.</p>


<!--
| Adding Emphasis
| ===============
| Be sure to use <em> and <strong> elements to make text italic or bold.
|
| The <b> and <i> elements have been deprecated since HTML4 so should not be used
| for this reason as they no longer have any semantic value.
| We now ofter use the <i> element for other reasons, such as housing icons.
-->

We apply science, technology and our <em>unparalleled</em> global network of resources to the pursuit of <strong>Building Better Worlds</strong>.

<!-- Use the small element to de-emphasise text. It is also commonly used for small print / legal notices -->
<small>2073 Weyland Industries. All rights reserved.</small>


<!--
| Abbreviations
| =============
-->

Any attempt to arrest a senior officer of <abbr title="Omni Consumer Products">OCP</abbr> results in shutdown.


<!--
| Addresses
| =========
| The first example shows a simple way to write a postal address.
|
| An alternate, more semantic method would include using microformats as in the second example,
| This makes use of the hCard microformat - http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard
| The hCard microformat also allows for other types of information, such as website or phone number.
-->

<!-- Simple solution -->
<address>
  221b Baker St<br>
  Marylebone<br>
  London<br>
  NW1 6XE
</address>

<!-- Using the hCard microformat -->
<div class="vcard">

  <!-- Full Name -->
  <p class="fn">Egon Spengler<p>

  <!-- Address -->
  <p class="adr">
    <span class="organization-name">Ghostbusters</span><br>
    <span class="street-address">14 North Moore St.</span><br>
    <span class="extended-address">Manhattan</span><br>
    <span class="locality">New York City</span><br>
    <span class="region">New York</span><br>
    <span class="postal-code">10013</span><br>
    <span class="country-name">USA</span>
  </p>

  <!-- Phone Number -->
  <p class="tel">555-2368</p>

</div>


<!--
| Blockquotes
| ===========
| Semantic citation markup is an ambiguous issue with no agreed correct implementation. The <cite> tag itself is
| only to be used for the title of a work, such as a book, paper, song, movie etc. It should not contain a persons name.
|
| This means we need something to wrap additional details, such as a name or date.
| HTML5 Doctor recommend using an invalid footer element within the blockquote:
| - http://html5doctor.com/blockquote-q-cite/#change-2011-07-11
| The official WHATWG recommendation is to put the blockquote in a figure and add attribution in <figcaption>:
| - http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2012-February/034822.html
|
| For now, we should use the Twitter Bootstrap method of using a <small> element.
