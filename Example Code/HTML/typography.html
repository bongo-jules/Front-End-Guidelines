<!--
| Headings
| ========
| Headings should be used with a document outline in mind. Ensure they follow a correct order
| which is kept consistent throughput the site.
|
| To visually change heading weighting without affecting the document outline, consider the
| Double-Stranded Heading Hierarchy - http://csswizardry.com/2012/02/pragmatic-practical-font-sizing-in-css/
-->

<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>

<!-- An example of the Double-Stranded Heading Hierarchy -->
<h3 class="h2">Heading 3 which looks like a Heading 2</h3>


<!--
| Paragraphs
| ==========
| Paragraph elements are used for grouping sections of text. Use CSS to add bottom margins
| to space paragraphs apart - never use multiple <br> tags for this purpose.
| There is very little reason to ever use <br> tags in HTML (outside of <address> elements).

<p>Donec congue lacinia dui, a porttitor lectus condimentum laoreet. Nunc eu ullamcorper orci.</p>
<p>In pellentesque faucibus vestibulum. Nulla at nulla justo, eget luctus tortor. Nulla facilisi.</p>


<!--
| Adding Emphasis
| ===============
| Be sure to use <em> and <strong> elements to make text italic or bold.
|
| The <b> and <i> elements have been deprecated since HTML4 so should not be used
| for this reason as they no longer have any semantic value.
| We now ofter use the <i> element for other reasons, such as housing icons.

<!--
| Addresses
| =========
| The first example shows a simple way to write a postal address.
|
| An alternate, more semantic method would include using microformats as in the second example,
| This makes use of the hCard microformat - http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard
| The hCard microformat also allows for other types of information, such as website or phone number.
