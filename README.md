# Front-End Coding Guidelines

This repo will eventually contain guideline documents and coding examples / templates which we can use in all our projects.

We can use these to standardise our code to increase quality and consistency.

For now access is pull only, as any changes will be reviewed at Front-End code review meetings. Please feel free to fork and submit pull-requests.

### Contribute

These guidelines are open to all suggestions. If you think something can be done better, please improve it â€“ that's the point of this project.

Once the content of this repository is up to scratch, we can make it public to hopefully get even more contributions.
