# Guidelines - Jade (Work in Progress)

## Overview

When writing Jade, use the same guidelines as when writing HTML. However, there are a few major differences to keep in mind.

## Quotes

While we always use double quotes for standard HTML, we use single quotes in Jade. These are quicker and easier to write, and automatically compiled to double quotes when the HTML is generated.
